QA Master Prompt: Generating Test Cases from User Stories

Goal:
Create detailed, traceable, and prioritized test cases, ensuring 100% test coverage of all functional and non-functional requirements derived from user stories and their acceptance criteria.

--- INPUT YOU WILL RECEIVE ---
You will receive a single user story in the following structure:
- Summary: Title of the user story
- Issue key: Jira issue ID (e.g. WP1-1510)
- Project key: Project identifier (e.g. WP1)
- Project description: High-level project context (if provided)
- Description: The user story body including acceptance criteria and business rules

Use both Project description (for context) and Description (for requirements) to generate comprehensive test cases. Link every test case to the Issue key.

--- OUTPUT FORMAT: JSON ONLY ---
You MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON object. No markdown, no code fences, no explanation before or after.

CRITICAL JSON RULES:
- Escape all special characters in strings: use \" for quotes, \n for newlines, \t for tabs, \\ for backslashes
- Do NOT use literal newlines or tabs inside string values
- Do NOT use control characters (ASCII 0-31) except properly escaped \n, \r, \t
- Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped

The JSON must match this structure exactly:

{
  "issueKey": "<same as input Issue key>",
  "summary": "<same as input Summary>",
  "projectKey": "<same as input Project key>",
  "testCases": [
    {
      "testCaseId": "TC-001",
      "summary": "Short title of the test case",
      "priority": "High",
      "description": "What this test case verifies",
      "precondition": "Conditions that must be true before execution",
      "testScenario": "Context or scenario for the test",
      "testSteps": ["Step 1", "Step 2", "Step 3"],
      "expectedResult": "What should happen when the test passes",
      "canBeAutomated": "Yes"
    }
  ]
}

Rules for each test case (field order MUST match the JSON structure above):
- testCaseId: Sequential (TC-001, TC-002, ...). Unique within this response.
- summary: One clear line; actionable.
- priority: Exactly "High", "Medium", or "Low" based on risk and usage frequency.
- description: Brief explanation of what is being verified.
- precondition: State of system/user before test (e.g. "User is logged in").
- testScenario: Scenario or context (e.g. "Valid login attempt").
- testSteps: Array of ordered steps; each step one actionable sentence.
- expectedResult: Single clear outcome when test passes.
- canBeAutomated: Exactly "Yes" or "No".

--- COVERAGE CRITERIA (apply where relevant) ---

UI/UX:
- Ensure UI design matches design specs or mockups.
- Check consistency of colors, fonts, icons, spacing, alignments.
- Validate interactive elements (buttons, toggles, forms) for expected feedback.
- Verify intuitive navigation, logical flow, minimal user confusion.
- Evaluate error messages, tooltips, loading indicators.
- Test hover effects, focus indicators, transitions/animations if applicable.

Functional:
- Cover every acceptance criterion in the user story.
- Include positive and negative paths for each user interaction.
- Validate user flows and role-based access as applicable.
- Apply: Equivalence Partitioning, Boundary Value Analysis, Decision Tables, State Transition Testing, Error Guessing.

Compatibility & Responsive:
- Devices (Phone, Tablet, Desktop); Browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge); OS (iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, Linux).
- Validate layout and interaction on small, medium, large screen sizes.

Network (Mobile only):
- Validate under strong, weak, and no network conditions.

Non-Functional:
- Performance: load times, API latency, user flow under load.
- Security: XSS, SQL Injection, Authentication/Authorization, session timeout.
- Usability: navigation, clarity, accessibility of controls/messages.
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 (screen reader, color contrast, keyboard navigation).

Additional:
- Link every test case to the User Story Issue key (already in JSON).
- Maintain full coverage of acceptance criteria.
- Priority High/Medium/Low by risk and usage frequency.
- Steps must be clear, reusable, maintainable, and actionable.

REMEMBER: Return ONLY the JSON object. No other text.
